Using a sample of 163,301 firm-year observations from the Chinese industrial enterprises for the period 2004–2014, we find that firm's robot adoption is positively related to pollution emissions reduction. Further mechanism tests show that the adoption of robots in production can improve a firm's productivity and alleviate a firm's financial constraint, thereby increasing the firm's pollution emissions reduction. In addition, we find that the above-mentioned effect of robot adoption on a firm's pollution emissions reduction is more pronounced for firms headquartered in regions with strong environmental regulations, firms that are high efficiency of pollution treatment and high technology-intensive, firms that have gone public and state-owned enterprises. Altogether, this study provides the first micro evidence on the relationship between robot adoption and corporate pollution emissions, providing significant implications for the world's sustainable development.","tags":[],"title":"Robot Adoption and Corporate Pollution Emissions: Evidence from China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiqian Cai","Yurou Wang","Wenchao Xu","Leo Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, public skepticism persists due to concerns over the unpredictability and biases of AI-powered systems. Through experiments involving two LLMs (GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus) and 1,095 human participants across 12 task sets, we investigated biases in large language models (LLMs) when making default judgments in peer-to-peer lending within the FinTech sector and examine decision-making performance and trust dynamics in human-machine collaboration. Our results indicate that LLMs consistently outperform humans in judgment accuracy—even without prior training on Chinese-language data and when processing unstructured information—highlighting their potential efficacy in FinTech applications. Both LLMs and human participants exhibit different bias structure, a mixing of elements of taste-based and statistical discrimination. Notably, LLMs exhibit a stronger tendency to lower the threshold for loan approvals for women, while imposing stricter loan terms on them, such as reduced lending amounts and higher interest rates. In collaborative settings, inputs from GPT-4 enhance human judgment accuracy, but providing human input does not improve the performance of either humans or LLMs. Participants exhibit significant algorithm aversion, which diminishes as the complexity or stakes of the lending situation increase. Additionally, women show a more pronounced algorithm aversion than men, although this difference lessens with higher complexity or lending stakes. These findings underscore the nuanced interplay between AI and human decision-making in FinTech lending and beyond, emphasizing the need for careful integration of AI systems to mitigate biases and improve lending outcomes.","tags":[],"title":"Bias and Trust in LLM-Driven Screening Automation: Experimental Insights from FinTech Lending","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zibin Huang","Yinan Liu","Mingming Ma","Leo Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

In July 2021, the Chinese government implemented the Double Reduction Policy, which banned for-profit academic private tutoring. We estimate the economic consequences of this policy on the education industry in China by employing two novel datasets containing online job postings and firm registration information. We find that within four months after the policy implementation, online job postings for tutoring-related firms decreased by 89%, tutoring-related firm entry decreased by 50\\%, and their exits tripled. Cities with 10,000 (2%) more children lost 50 (3.7%) more education-related job opportunities, experienced 0.3 (5.9%) fewer firm entries, and 0.1 (1.3%) more firm exits per month. Surprisingly, not only academic tutoring firms were impacted, but also untargeted businesses involving in arts and sports tutoring were also heavily struck, although they were encouraged by the policy to promote children's non-academic ability. This negative spillover can be partly explained by the interconnected ownership structure among academic and non-academic tutoring firms. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that this policy led to 3 million job losses in four months and at least 11 billion RMB Value Added Tax losses in 18 months nationally.","tags":[],"title":"Biting the Hand That Teaches: Unraveling the Economic Impact of Banning Private Tutoring in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Readers who have followed our previous two articles will find that the recruitment data we use is up to the end of 2022.\nBut in 2023, it seems to have entered a new era, the rapid launch of various generative AI has brought unprecedented shocks. The most representative of generative AI is OpenAI’s large language model - ChatGPT. Many people, through personal trials, feel a deep crisis while being shocked by technology, as if their work can be easily replaced by AI. This emotion was quickly captured by various media and marketing numbers, and was amplified to the point where everyone knows it through individual interviews and literary interpretations. However, so far, serious research on the impact of generative AI (or narrowly to large models) on the job market is still rare.\nThe most meaningful research at present is actually from OpenAI itself. OpenAI in their latest working paper “GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models”, discussed in depth the possible impact of AI on the labor market.\n   In this article, researchers found that under the impact of the increasingly popular large language model (LLM), at least 80% of the US workforce will be affected, and 10% of their work will be replaced by LLM. Among them, 19% of the US workforce has more than 50% of the work to be replaced.\nNote that the above research is only limited to the US job market. So, what about China? This is a super-large but completely different labor market from the United States, and it is also facing population aging and various labor-capital contradictions; how many of the various positions in China will be replaced or even disappear due to the impact of large language models?\nIn this article, we will use the ideas of OpenAI’s working paper, use recruitment data from China, and use our independently designed methods to try to give a comprehensive data answer to this public concern that goes beyond emotional cognition and covers all occupations.\nDiscussion on the key issue of AI substitution: What exactly is each profession doing? To analyze to what extent a position can be replaced by GPT or other derived AI models, the first thing to clarify is a key issue:\nWhat exactly is each profession doing?\nWe often see in marketing numbers that AI will replace secretaries, AI will replace programmers, and so on. But this is a very vague expression. In essence, what AI replaces is not a vague professional name in public cognition, but the functions and work content contained in this profession.\nSo, what are the functions contained in the profession? On the recruitment website, we will see “job description”, for example, the job description of a typical human resources department employee may include the following content:\n Recruitment of new employees, handling of employee entry procedures Arrangement and implementation of new employee entry training Attendance and salary performance calculation Maintenance and expansion of the company’s recruitment channels, assistance in social recruitment and other recruitment activities …  Everyone can see that each of these is a function of the human resources department. And each function includes richer work content. For example, “arrange and carry out new employee entry training”, which includes the following specific work content - 1, writing, preparing training materials; 2, communication, communication and arrangement of schedule; 3, speech, training, improve employee skills… and other specific work content.\nWhen the work structure of the “human resources specialist” profession is broken down into several or even dozens of functions and work content, it is only possible to judge how likely it is that the content of “writing, preparing training materials” will be impacted by AI, so as to produce specific, quantifiable, and meaningful answers.\nWell, then the question is, how can we get the function and work content information of each profession? In order to obtain the task decomposition information of various occupations, the Onet database is used in the OpenAI paper. Onet, the full name is Occupational Information Network, is a free online database based on standardized American occupations. This database has completed all (American) professional decompositions.\nSo does China have a database like Onet? Unfortunately, there is currently no, and because there is a certain difference between China and the United States in the definition of occupations, the occupations in the Onet database are difficult to form an accurate mapping relationship with the standard occupations in the Chinese Occupational Dictionary.\nSo we adopted an indirect matching method, using real recruitment data on the market as a medium, each piece of recruitment data, through the method in the previous article, simultaneously maps to the Chinese standard profession and the O*net standard profession, and then summarizes according to the Chinese …","date":1680912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680912000,"objectID":"c6629fee73228fb7a6695c35061b1e9e","permalink":"https://leoyang.org/post/online_job_3/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/online_job_3/","section":"post","summary":"The article discusses the potential impact of large language models, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, on the job market.

What phenomena can we observe from this data? In this article, we will explore these questions.\nRelation Between Recruitment Data and Actual Employment Data Firstly, it’s important to clarify that not all jobs can find corresponding recruitment data. For example, in the first major category, “Officials of Party Organs, State Organs, Mass Organizations, Social Organizations, and Leaders of Enterprises and Institutions,” most jobs do not recruit online. In “Clerical and Related Workers,” many positions are also only recruited through civil service or institutional exams, and hence, they do not appear on recruitment websites. Similar situations occur with police, military, and agricultural, forestry, fishing and husbandry related positions.\nTherefore, the results shown by the recruitment data are closer to what we often refer to as the “working-class” category. In this category, there are 357 occupations that can find corresponding recruitment data.\nSo, to what extent can recruitment data relate to actual employment data?\nBy comparing recruitment data from 2015-2022 with the occupational population data from the seventh national census in 2020, we get the following graph.\n   As can be seen, positions with more recruitment are indeed the ones with more employment in the seventh census. The employment numbers for certain positions are higher than recruitment numbers, especially for metal product manufacturing workers, construction workers, etc. On the other hand, for some jobs such as news publishing, cultural arts and sports professionals, recruitment numbers are higher than employment numbers, reflecting different job tendencies for online recruitment. Blue-collar jobs rarely recruit on major recruitment websites, while white-collar jobs do the opposite.\nOverall, the correlation between the recruitment data and the actual number of people employed in the industry reaches 0.57. Analyzing recruitment data will be a great tool for us to analyze the Chinese labor market.\nHighest Paying Professions The content that people care about the most is probably the wage level for each job. Which jobs have the highest salaries? Many people might guess, influenced by mass media, that the top ranking ones should be computer-related or business-related professions.\nBut the reality is more complex than we imagined.\nThe following table lists the top ten highest paying jobs each year from 2015 to 2022. Some positions are quite rare, so we cannot guarantee absolute accuracy. Hence, this table excludes positions with fewer recruitments.\n   Surprisingly, many unexpected jobs appear in the table.\nIn the past eight years, the position that has topped the salary chart the most is — models. Models have appeared six times in the top ten list, missing out only in 2017 and 2022, and their ranking has been stable around the 4th to 5th place from 2018 to 2021.\nThe next three positions that frequently lead the salary charts are sonographers, futures traders, and information security engineers, who all made the list four times in eight years. Business and computer science each claim a position here. Sonographers emerge as the most stable in medical professions.\nThen there are nine jobs that made the list three times in eight years. They are electronic component engineering technicians, computer software engineering technicians, data analysis and processing engineering technicians, dermatologists, accountants, writers, flight attendants, marriage consultants, and marital and family counselors.\nAmong these nine jobs, there are three computer-related ones, one in business, and one in medical. These three major fields have taken up five positions. Programmers finally made the list.\nHere we can see that the classification of standard jobs is highly specific. The term “programmer” seems a bit too broad in definition.\nThe “information security engineering technician” that ranks highest in the previous text, making the list four times in eight years, can be considered a type of programmer.\nThe “data analysis and processing engineering technician” who is proficient in Python, R, and SQL could possibly be considered half a programmer.\nEven for those primarily engaged in coding, in the Chinese standard occupational classification system, they are divided into two types.\nOne is the “computer software engineering technician” that made the list three times in eight years, coded as 2-02-10-03 in the Chinese standard occupation, meaning “engineering technicians who engage in computer software research, requirements analysis, design, testing, maintenance, and management”.\nAnother type is called “computer programmer,” coded as 4-04-05-01 in the Chinese standard occupation, meaning “personnel who engage in computer and mobile terminal application program design and coding”.

The theme of this series is the career development of migrant workers. We will start from the existing recruitment data and use scientific data processing methods to present the current situation to readers. The occupational income growth curves of different occupations in different cities are also combined with the recent hot spots of public opinion to estimate the occupational substitution that AI may produce.\nAs the first tweet in the series, I will start with the data used in this series of research and the grouping of “occupations”. I hope that after readers understand these basic information and methods, they will be more specific about the follow-up occupational salary and AI replacement rate. The data list has a more accurate understanding.\nRecruitment data of the same age as the Internet in China If you want to ask, among all kinds of Internet data, what type of data is easy to obtain, has a very large amount of information, and has a relatively long look-back time? My answer is - recruitment data.\nGo back in time to more than 20 years ago. At that time, most ordinary families did not have their own computers, let alone the Internet, and what was the most attractive online behavior? Not “surfing the web” or “chatting in a chat room”. On September 13, 2000 , an article in “Science and Technology Daily” mentioned:\n“With the rapid development of our country’s economy , the Internet is gradually accepted by the public. According to survey statistics , among the current Internet users , those who use the Internet for the purpose of job hunting account for half of the Internet population.”\nOn October 9, 2000, an article in “Internet Weekly” “Where to find a job in the future?” The article “Comparison of Recruitment Websites” cites a survey by CNNIC in July 2000. Among the information people obtain online, recruitment information accounts for 26.11%.\n   In 1997 , ChinaHR and Zhaopin.com were established; In 1999 , 51job was established. In 2005 , 58.com , a job-seeking website for fresh graduates (yingjiesheng), was established. In the mobile Internet era after 2010 , various recruitment websites and apps have sprung up like mushrooms after a spring rain. Liepin, Boss Zhipin, Lagou… expand the dimension of recruitment data again.\nFrom the high-salary offers coveted by elite school students to domestic service and short-term odd jobs for blue-collar workers, the recruitment data has accumulated not only the story of generations of workers, but also the epitome of the Chinese economy over the past two decades.\nRecruitment data, which has appeared and grown together with China’s first generation of Internet users since the beginning of the millennium, is a piece of data that is almost the same age as the Chinese Internet.\nRecruitment Data: Representativeness Problem and Simpson’s Paradox Hiring data is also very difficult data to work with . Only through simple processing, it is difficult to present consistent, representative and valuable information.\nThe representativeness problem has always been a big problem for recruitment data. What kind of companies recruit online, and what kind of companies choose to recruit from other channels? All along, Internet companies, foreign companies, etc., use recruitment websites much more frequently than state-owned companies and manufacturing companies. This makes the total recruitment volume, total resume delivery volume, and average salary indicators obtained through recruitment data summary have a not small bias from the real national average. The recruitment situation of different recruitment websites also varies greatly.\nFor example, the following picture is a screenshot of the hot jobs of BOSS Direct Recruitment:\n   The following picture is a screenshot of the hot search positions for Shanghai recruitment from 58 same cities:\n   As you can see, the types and directions of recruitment information on the two websites are completely different. When we only use one or several recruitment websites, we inevitably miss a lot, and we cannot output effective conclusions.\nIn addition, the classification of recruitment data is extremely difficult, which also increases its use threshold. When we use various big data, we often need to match this data with the data of the National Bureau of Statistics according to the appropriate classification standards to get similar caliber data, which is convenient for us to verify the validity of the data.\nBut for recruitment data, although we have collected 500 million recruitment data and 1.2 billion recruitment vacancies from multiple recruitment website sources through data partners in the past eight years, if we just summarize these recruitment positions, whether it is divided by company, industry or region, it is very difficult to compare with official statistical data.\nWhy can’t massive data get effective conclusions?\nFirst, the number of …","date":1680739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680739200,"objectID":"00b2fbefa72594d444bab560052c4d63","permalink":"https://leoyang.org/post/online_job_1/","publishdate":"2023-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/online_job_1/","section":"post","summary":"This article discusses the process of standardizing and categorizing job positions using AI and text learning, with the aim of avoiding data misinterpretation due to incorrect classifications.

Intended to \"Build a National Wall\" against overseas influence, this policy inadvertently created \"Provincial Walls\" within the country. Using unique high-frequency panel data from 200 influential Weibo accounts and a data leakage incident, coupled with a rigorous methodological approach, I demonstrate that the policy effectively reduces public discourse and regime-threatening information. However, it does so not by suppressing overseas users but by deterring domestic users from engaging in out-of-province discussions. This policy also has unintended effects, such as strengthening local identities, which can intensify geo-group division at the expense of national cohesion, and heighten cross-provincial conflict, potentially exacerbating social tensions. These findings reveal the complex impacts of user tagging policies in authoritarian regimes. While they may offer short-term benefits in controlling information, they can also create long-term challenges by aggravating the dictator's informational dilemma and fostering conditions conducive to collective action.","tags":["Media Politics"],"title":"Sowing Division: The Unintended Consequences of Geographic Tagging on Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Cao (Stanford University)","Yiqing Xu (Stanford University)","Leo Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

While previous research has examined the separate strategies of censorship and propaganda used by authoritarian regimes to control information, our work aims to bridge the gap by examining the intersection of these two tactics in China. Specifically, we focus on how government-affiliated accounts use propaganda content and censor undesirable comments under their posts. We utilize a unique, high-frequency dataset and conduct two survey experiments to answer three research questions. First, why and when government-affiliated accounts choose to moderate their comment sections? Second, what are the causal effects of comment section censorship on remaining content and user engagement. Third, how does comment section moderation influence public opinion by altering second-order beliefs.","tags":[],"title":"Gaslighting: Comment Moderation on Chinese Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ji Yeon Hong (University of Michigan)","Leo Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Media Supervision on Chinese Majors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leo Yang"],"categories":["Data Insights"],"content":"The complete and diversified supply chain has become increasingly important in the international situation in recent years. The trade war between China and the United States has lasted for nearly 2 years. Although there are signs of easing now (?), the confrontation between China and the United States in other aspects will only increase, not decrease. The most intense place of confrontation between China and the United States, and the direction that is most likely to bring uncertainty in the future, is naturally the southeast of the mainland. Don’t say that you didn’t predict it, prepare for the rain first. If the war in the southeast unfortunately breaks out, the industrial chain of mainland China will naturally be affected, especially the potential damage caused by the war and the obstruction of transportation, which will cause major impacts on enterprises that rely on the industrial chain of Taiwan. This article uses the monthly product import data of China’s imports and exports to Taiwan to analyze the scale and scope of this possible impact, and provide a possible pre-plan for mainland enterprises to prepare in advance.\nImport Dependence on Taiwan Products First, we look at which products in the mainland area have a higher dependence on Taiwan. According to the quantity of goods imported from all over the world in China in the past five years, I calculated the proportion of Taiwan products. The top 10 products are as follows:\n   HS8 Product Code HS8 Product Name Import Taiwan Product Proportion     01069011 Tadpoles and froglets for pure breeding 100%   03028200 Fresh or frozen rays 100%   03028500 Fresh or ice fresh bass 100%   03034900 Frozen tuna 100%   03062110 Cultivated lobsters and crayfish 100%   03062210 Cultivated lobsters 100%   03062910 Other cultivated edible crustaceans 100%   03063110 Cultivated live spiny lobsters and other sea lobsters 100%   03063210 Cultivated live lobsters 100%   03063391 Live/fresh/ice fresh freshwater crabs, non-breeding 100%    The products with an import proportion of 100% from Taiwan are concentrated on the procurement of Taiwan’s agricultural products. Due to the mainland’s Taiwan policy, such results should not be surprising. Although the import proportion of these products in Taiwan is high, from another perspective, these products can be self-sufficient in the mainland, but they choose to purchase from Taiwan for policy reasons. These policy-oriented import purchases, especially the purchase of agricultural products, have very strong substitutability: just don’t eat tuna and crayfish for a while. Therefore, when analyzing the import proportion, we should ignore categories such as agricultural products and aquatic products, and focus on industrial raw materials, intermediate products, and finished products. These products are the imported products that may cause shocks to the supply chain.\nTherefore, we remove all agricultural and pastoral products, toys, jewelry and other final consumer goods, and only consider 42 major categories of products including chemicals, electrical equipment, machines, and measurement and inspection instruments. Among these 36 major categories, there are 220 sub-categories of products, and the proportion of products imported from Taiwan in the mainland area exceeds 50%. Among them, the proportion of imported Taiwan products reached 100%:\n   HS8 Product Code HS8 Product Name Import Taiwan Product Proportion     29071310 Nonylphenol 100%   29394400 Ephedrine and its salts 100%   30032015 Neither standard dose nor retail packaged cefaclor drugs 100%   30042011 Cefixime drugs in dosage or retail packaging 100%   37024100 Color film, unexposed, unperforated, width \u0026gt;610mm, length \u0026gt;200m 100%   85211019 Other tape recorders 100%   84261943 Well frame unloading bridge 100%   84451329 Other cotton yarn roving machines 100%   84619011 Double column (open) planer 100%   84631019 Cold drawn tube rack, drawing force 300t 100%    Nonylphenol, which has an import ratio of 100%, is an important fine chemical raw material and intermediate. It is mainly used to produce surfactants, antioxidants, textile dyeing and finishing aids, lubricant additives, pesticide emulsifiers, resin modifiers, resin and rubber stabilizers and other fields. However, interestingly, since 2007, the Ministry of Commerce has initiated anti-dumping investigations on nonylphenol originating in Taiwan and imposed anti-dumping taxes ranging from 6% to 20%. However, as of 2019, the import of nonylphenol still highly depends on Taiwan.\nSo, next we need to analyze, these 220 sub-categories of products, once the war is cut off, whether our country is easy to get substitutes from other countries on the supply chain? Here we use an index that describes the degree of concentration, the Herfindahl index (HHI), to represent the dispersion of the source of a certain type of product imported by our country.
